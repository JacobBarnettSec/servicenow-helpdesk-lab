# ServiceNow Help Desk Ticketing Project

## Overview
This project demonstrates hands-on experience working inside a ServiceNow Personal Developer Instance (PDI) to create, categorize, and document realistic Help Desk incidents. My goal was to simulate real-world IT support workflows, practice incident triage, and build a portfolio that reflects practical troubleshooting skills across multiple IT domains.

I created five incidents covering the most common categories handled by IT Support teams: access issues, hardware troubleshooting, network connectivity, software support, and internal application requests.

## Objectives
- Practice navigating and working within a ServiceNow instance  
- Create realistic Help Desk tickets with proper categorization  
- Apply ITIL-aligned prioritization using Impact and Urgency  
- Document troubleshooting steps clearly and professionally  
- Build a portfolio-ready demonstration of IT support fundamentals

## Reflection
Working through these tickets helped reinforce how structured Help Desk workflows are. Even in a simulated environment, the process of categorizing incidents, documenting troubleshooting steps, and applying Impact/Urgency mirrors real IT support operations. This project strengthened my confidence in navigating ServiceNow and handling common support scenarios end-to-end.
